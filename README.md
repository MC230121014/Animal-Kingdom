This project shows how to use object-oriented programming concepts in a fun and engaging way.
Animal Kingdom is a virtual world simulation, where different types of animals are represented as an object and it's interaction within the virtual world.
The project required the development of a Critter class, which served as the foundation for all the critters in the simulation. The Critter class defined variables and methods that all critters shared.
In addition, the project required the creation of several Critter subclasses, each with its own set of characteristics and behaviors.
